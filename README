I love django-chunks but the name confused people.

This is a fork of the popular django-chunks project with the addition of a field "active" which is a BooleanField for controlling the display of the content on the site.

Added slug and header fields. Replaced key with title. All template tags should use the slug.
Added translation strings to model.

TODO: make a better README
TODO: implement header usage in template tag.
